Scripts Versions:
Creating Versions of scripts allows us to always keep a working copy of the scripts. When the scripts are working, they must be zipped and a date stamp must be added. Example: Schroeder_Phase_Scripts_Version_1_2012_05_08.zip.
Before committing any changes to the scripts to SVN, DON'T FORGET TO WARN YOUR COLLEAGUES!
